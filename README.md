# Multiplayer Piano Bot Code Converted to C#
This repository contains the C# conversion of a Multiplayer Piano (MPP) bot code. The original code was written in JavaScript and has been converted to C# for use in a .NET environment.

The MPP bot code allows for automating tasks and actions within the Multiplayer Piano website, a virtual piano platform that allows users to play together in real-time. With the use of bots, it is possible to automate certain actions, such as playing a pre-defined song, or interacting with other users in the chat.

This C# conversion includes all of the functionality of the original JavaScript code, and has been optimized for use in a .NET environment. The code is well-documented, making it easy for developers to understand and modify as needed for their specific use-case.
